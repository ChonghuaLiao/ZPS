# ZPS

This repository contains the official code for ZPS.

In our paper, we provide ZPS, an algorithm for zero-label prompt selection. ZPS choose a optimal prompt from the manual prompt candidates without labeled data or parameter update.


## Contents
We provide code for both zero-label setting and few-shot setting. Including
- Zero-label
    - ZPS
    - Self-training
- Few-shot
    - ICL
    - GPS
    - GRIPS
